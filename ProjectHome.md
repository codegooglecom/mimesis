Mimesis is an Open Source PHP Flat File Database low-level API designed to act as a backend for server-side scripts that require database functionality.

Instead of parsing SQL statements, Mimesis uses PHP's object-oriented constructs to provide a distinct class with various database manipulation methods.

Mimesis guarantees that database transactions are processed reliably by adhering to the following database theory principles:

  * Atomicity
  * Consistency
  * Isolation
  * Durability
